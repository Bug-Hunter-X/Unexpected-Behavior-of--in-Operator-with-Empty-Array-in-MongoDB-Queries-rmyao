# Unexpected Behavior of $in Operator with Empty Array in MongoDB Queries

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator used with an empty array.  The issue arises because the query returns no results, even if documents contain the field `field` with null, undefined, or other default values. This can be problematic in scenarios where you expect to retrieve all documents when providing an empty array as a filter.

## Problem

When the `$in` operator is provided with an empty array, it effectively acts as a condition that no document can satisfy. This leads to an empty result set, regardless of the presence or absence of the queried field in the collection. This is different from other operators that could handle `null` or default values in a different manner.

## Solution

The solution is to check whether the array is empty before constructing the query. If the array is empty, modify the query to retrieve all documents using an empty filter `{}` instead.

## Reproduction Steps

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have MongoDB set up and running.
3.  Execute `bug.js` to observe the issue. 
4.  Execute `bugSolution.js` to see the correct way to handle an empty array in the query.
